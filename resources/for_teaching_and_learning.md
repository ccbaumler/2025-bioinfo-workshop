## Markdown

- [The Markdown guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/), [GitHub Guide on Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) and [a blog post on Markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). Any are great references to understand the basics of Markdown.
- [HackMD, a freemium browser tool for creating simple Markdown notes and websites](https://hackmd.io)
    - Register for a free account for a workspace. There you can create any number of notes that may be published as a website in a single click, organize them with folders and tags, and sync to your GitHub account.
    - The live editing feature of HackMD allows you to catch errors and see any formatting issue immediately. It can be a timesaver to type your markdown documents in HackMD first to add into your GitHub later.
    - HackMD is a great solution for a simple, one page website. It is also easily accessible through a smart phone to make edits or take notes while away from a computer.
    - [HackMD's Official Tutorial](https://hackmd.io/c/tutorials/%2Fs%2Ftutorials)
- GitHub relies heavily on Markdown. 
    - [Learn how to communicate on GitHub using markdown](https://github.com/skills/communicate-using-markdown)
    - GitHub also makes it possible to create a full website with markdown and GitHub Pages. [An example from Dr. Julin Maloof](https://jnmaloof.github.io/BIS180L_web/about/)
